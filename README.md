# hello-world
This is my first step in to the Github world!

M.Sc. economics student at FSU Jena with data science orientation. During my master and bachelor educations, I actively used RStudio and Excel for statistical and econometrical analysis in economics and finance fields. I also recently completed SAP S/4 HANA course and I reached C1 level in German during my studies in Germany. I am currently a participant of data science and machine learning bootcamp where I improve my coding skills in python programming language and SQL through working on real business projects. As a data science oriented economics guy, I am ready to dedicate all of my knowledge and skills for my future team. I like to helping people, solving problems and learning new things. 
Long live data science!

When you read this message, I am gonna be so ahead of my current level..
